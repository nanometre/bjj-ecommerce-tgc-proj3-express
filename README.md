## 1. Project Summary

### Project Context
Grapple Gears is an e-commerce web application for Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ) gears and apparels. BJJ is a martial art and combat sport based on ground fighting and submission holds. The e-commerce web application serves to provide a platform for:
* brands to reach out to a larger customer pool by listing their products; and
* customers to exclusively browse and purchase for BJJ gears and apparels. 


## 2. UI/UX

### Strategy

#### Organisation Objectives

To create an e-commerce web application to sell BJJ products exclusively. The organisation aims to collaborate with as many different BJJ product brands as possible to list their products on the platform. This will create a centralised platform for customers to browse and purchase a wide variety of products. The organisation profits by charging the brands a small platform listing fee and by selling products to customers at a slight markup from the wholesale price.

#### User Objectives

**BJJ Product Brand Owners | Adults (20 - 60 years old)**:

User Story: Small brand owners who are starting out often face difficulties to enter the market when there are existing big players in the field. And as a small business, they generally have limited budget for advertisement which make it difficult to gain exposure on their products. For large brand owners, a cheap way to gain additional exposure on their products would benefit their business.

Acceptance Criteria: A convenient and cost effective way to advertise their products to a greater customer pool, hence allowing their business to grow.

**Customers | Adults (20 - 60 years old)**:

User Story: BJJ product brands owners either only sell their products on their web application or sell a small variety of their products on general marketplaces. For potential customers to browse all of the specific brand's products, they would need to visit the brand's web application. Hence, to browse and search multiple brands' products, customer would be required to navigate through multiple web applications.

Acceptance Criteria: To easily browse a variety of BJJ products from different brands, search for a specific product based on certain criteria, and purchasing the products on a single web application. Being able to discover new brands would be an added benefit.
